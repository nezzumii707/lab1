# GitHub is a popular web-based platform for version control and collaboration, primarily used by developers to manage code projects. It is built around Git, a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code over time, enabling multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. GitHub allows users to host repositories, contribute to open-source projects, review code, and manage software development workflows. It also provides features like issue tracking, continuous integration, and documentation hosting, making it an essential tool for collaborative software development.
